We have made a game of Boggle with a gui
representation.
The game is stractured as thus:
In the middle of the screen there are 16
buttons arranged as a 4*4 matrix.
Each button has the letter it represents
written upon it.
Above the buttons there is the User interface which shows
The current word made out of the buttons pressed and shows warnings
if the need arise.

On the right there are 4 buttons:
check word:
Which checks if the letters in the current buttons
pressed make up for a word in the games word dictionary. If there is no such word - nothing will happen.
If there is - points will be given and the selected letters will be cleared.
reset:
Which resets all buttons into their un-pressed condition
and resets the user iterface to it's cleared state.
restart game:
Which restarts the game using a new board.
Hint:
Which offers the player a hint with the cost of 10 points.
On the left of the screen there is a list of all the words found by the player.

Additional features we have added to the game:
1. The reset and restart game buttons.
2. An optional Hint
3.When right-clicking on the last button pressed the game will release that button. 
4. Design: The buttons are highlightend when the mouse is above them
and change colour when they are pressed.
